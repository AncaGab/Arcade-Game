The **arcade game** is a game where you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs).
The main objective of the player is to reach the water, without colliding with the enemies.
The player can move, up-down-left-right!

===============================
Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

## Play-Game

Open index.html with your favorite browser.

The game and the timer starts when you move the player.
Your main goal is to bring the player to the side of the water. If on the way you clash with the enemy you will be added a point in the "Bugs accident", while if you can reach the water your point will go to "Safe".

     
## Game-Over 

The game ends when you can bring the player to safety 10 times.

At the end a modal will open containing the time during the game.

Have fun playing !
